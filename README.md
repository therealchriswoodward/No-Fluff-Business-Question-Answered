# Zero Fluff Data-Driven Decision-Making in Real-Life Business

## Description:
This project serves to display a real-life business scenario where I use my skills to solve problems in plain simple English for non-technical stakeholders. I am intentionally stripping away all fanciness and fluff, and getting straight to the answer to the question in the scenario.

_This is not to show off coding and technical skills; this is to show off question-answering skills._

## Real-Life Business Scenario:
A company decides to run an advertisement over the course of a month. They come to me and ask me to find out if it made a difference in their sales.

## What You Will See In My Notebook
* ***Clear Communication:*** A straight to the point method for answering the question in a plain English way so stakeholders can understand without time being wasted on a flashy dashboard.

* ***Appendix Section for Visuals:*** Not everything is relevant to the question, so these bits of information are separate but available if needed.

* ***Detailed Explanation of My Methods:*** Explanations detailed, but still in easy-to-understand language.
